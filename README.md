# GradleLegacyNativeMigration
 Example of migrating a legacy native body of source to Gradle

This is an attempt to create an example of migrating an existing C/C++ project from makefiles to Gradle, and dealing with all the non-Gradle-way things that are required.

The goal is to be able to swap to a new build system without having to refactor everything else at the same time, once that is done, then it becomes easir to move the project to a newer style layout (if desired).

There are still rough edges, some things that don't work, and certainly some things that could be improved.
